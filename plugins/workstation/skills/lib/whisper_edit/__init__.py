"""Shared engine for the MacWhisper split/combine skills.

This package is the one tested code path for *writing* to MacWhisper's
`main.sqlite` + `ExternalMedia/`. The three planned skills
(`personal-whisper-db-split`, `-db-combine`, `-db-split-combine`) are thin
entry points that call these library functions in-process; the orchestrator
skill composes split + combine here rather than re-invoking the other skills.

Read `specs/macwhisper-database.md` for the schema, time model, soft-delete,
FTS triggers, the §1 safety contract, and the §10 unverified assumptions this
engine is built to validate against a backup before any real run.

Module map:

- `db`        — guarded read-write open (refuses while MacWhisper runs;
                checkpoints the WAL), hex/UUID/datetime conventions, schema-drift
                column resolution.
- `backup`    — timestamped DB + referenced-media backup with a rollback manifest.
- `model`     — immutable source types + the read-only `Bundle` loader, plus the
                UUID-free target types (`TargetBundle`) used by split/combine/clone.
- `media`     — `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` behind a protocol, sample-accurate cut/concat,
                filename generation, and the overridable 8-hex suffix strategy.
- `selection` — rank session candidates from fuzzy title/date/time hints.
- `split`     — `split_bundle` + silence/speaker-onset split-point detection.
- `combine`   — `combine_bundles` (offset, speaker union, audio concat).
- `clone`     — pure `plan_clone` + transactional `apply_clone` materialization.
- `verify`    — post-write integrity/alignment/FTS checks.
- `report`    — human summaries (never deletes; never claims to).
- `engine`    — the `identify -> plan -> apply` flow the skills call.

Stdlib-only and runnable on macOS system Python 3.9, matching `lib/whisper/`.
